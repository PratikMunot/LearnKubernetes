### Exercise 1.2
Lets create a YAML file for our nginx deployment. Create a new file "nginx-deployment.yaml" and paste the following configurations

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
The first spec is specification for Deployment and the second spec is specification for pods. 
> Once the yaml file is ready then execute the apply command as follow
> ```
> # kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
> ```


> Lets validate if our deployment / pods / replicaset was created successfully or not
> ```
> # kubectl get deployment
> NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
> nginx-deployment     2/2     2            2           19s
> 
> # kubectl get pods
> NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
> nginx-deployment-95585b474-l4m66      1/1     Running   0          32s
> nginx-deployment-95585b474-mlpjk      1/1     Running   0          32s
>
> # kubectl get replicaset
> NAME                            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
> nginx-deployment-95585b474      2         2         2       54s
```
