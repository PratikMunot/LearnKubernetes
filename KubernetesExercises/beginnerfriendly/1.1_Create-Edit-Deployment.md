### Exercise 1
CRUD Operations on deployment - (Create/Read/Update/Delete) 
Lets create a Deployment -> then we edit the live deployment to use new image -> Save the deployment and validate the changes if done correctly -> Display/Read the deployment -> And finally delete the deployment 

> Step 1 (Create a new nginx deployent)
> ```
> # kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx
> ```


> Step 2 (Display/Validate if new nginx deployent was created successfully)
> ```
> # kubectl get deployment
> NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
> nginx-depl           1/1     1            1           4h46m
> ```

> Step 3 (Edit the deployent)
> When we hit the below edit command we see that there is an auto generated yaml file already created by default with all the default parameters. Scroll below to the image section and edit the image from nginx to nginx:1.16 and save it. Now if you try to display the pods again you can see that the old pod is terminating or deleted and a new pod will be created
> ```
> # kubectl edit deployment nginx-depl
> ```

> Step 4 (Delete the deployent)
> When we delete the deployment the deployment itself gets deleted followed by replicaset followed by pods.
> ```
> # kubectl delete deployment nginx-depl
> ```
