# What is Kubernetes

> Kubernetes is an open-source Container orchestration framework/tool or engine that automates deploying, scaling, scheduling, load balancing and  managing containerized application on a group of servers.
>
> Kubernetes orchestrates clusters of virtual machines and schedules containers to run on those virtual machines based on their available compute resources and the resource requirements of each container. Containers are grouped into pods, the basic operational unit for Kubernetes and those pods scale to your desired state.
>
> As applications grow to span multiple containers deployed across multiple servers, operating them becomes more complex. To manage this complexity, Kubernetes provides an open source API that controls how and where those containers will run
>
> Kubernetes also automatically manages service discovery, incorporates load balancing, tracks resource allocation and scales based on compute utilisation. And, it checks the health of individual resources and enables apps to self-heal by automatically restarting or replicating containers
>
> Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Its a Container management / Orchestration tool. A container management tool manages containerized applications that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
>
> It distributes application workloads across a Kubernetes cluster and automates dynamic container networking needs.
>
> - Kubernetes is a Greek word for Helmsman or captain of a ship
> - Kubernetes was originally developed by Google and later donated to CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation).
> - It is written in Go programming language.
> - Github repo – github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
> - Like Kubernetes some other container orchestration platforms are Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos Marathon.It manages applications on a platform like Docker



# Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do
> Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?
>
> Keeping containerised apps up and running can be complex because they often involve many containers deployed across different machines. Kubernetes provides a way to schedule and deploy those containers—plus scale them to your desired state and manage their lifecycles. Use Kubernetes to implement your container-based applications in a portable, scalable and extensible way.
>
> That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more. For example, Kubernetes can easily manage a canary deployment for your system.



The need for container orchestration tool – 
-	Trend from monolithic to microservices
-	Increased usage of containers
-	Demand for a proper way of managing those hundreds of containers
Features of container orchestration tool (Kunbernetes)–
-	High Availability or no downtime 
-	Scalability or high performance
-	Disaster Recovery – backup and restore 
-	Automatic bin packaging
-	Service discovery and load balancing
-	Storage orchestration and self healing
